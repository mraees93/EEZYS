<div class="container-fluid">
<p>I am a Sports Scientist from ETA college and I am really passionate about sports and fitness. 

    I have 5 years of working experience as a personal trainer. The sports I have participated in are cricket, soccer, rugby and boxing and as a result I have lost 56kgs over the last few years. Two years ago I started my own fitness business where I train people at my home gym in Lansdowne.
    My experience in sports, working as a fitness instructor, starting my own business and my weight loss journey, I have learnt many good qualities such as discipline, perseverance, leadership, entrepeneural skills, sales and marketing, good nutrition etc. All these factors lead to me becoming an exceptional fitness trainer, which is inspiring to all the clients that i have trained in the past and present. 
    
    To conclude, I am confident in my abilty to help my clients reach their fitness goals. As everyone knows I'm the best coach in Cape Town.</p>
